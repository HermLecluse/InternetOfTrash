gantt: into the trash it goes
-	based on research questions
-	project phases
sensors should be part of research questions
have phases for each research question
study project management
define work packages -> deliverables -> activities -> planning

problem description
be more specific: what does being efficient mean?
why is it difficult to come up with a good solution

research objective
can be more general
be a broader goal that this project contributes to. does not have to be the end all solution.

research questions:
Q1: could be part of the problem description
could also be a subquestion of the last research question.

SWOT
????????????????????????
trash it

stakeholders

hypothesis
into the trash it goes

interview questions
present ideas to government and get feedback from them

why are you not doing this allready


general comments:

become more specific.
