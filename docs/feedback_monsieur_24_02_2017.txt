gantt: into the trash it goes
-	based on research questions
-	project phases
sensors should be part of research questions
have phases for each research question
study project management
define work packages -> deliverables -> activities -> planning

problem description
be more specific: what does being efficient mean?
why is it difficult to come up with a good solution

research objective
can be more general
be a broader goal that this project contributes to. does not have to be the end all solution.

research questions:
Q1: could be part of the problem description
could also be a subquestion of the last research question.

stakeholders

hypothesis
into the trash it goes

interview questions
present ideas to government and get feedback from them
